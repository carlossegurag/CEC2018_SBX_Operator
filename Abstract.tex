The usual Muti-objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) are designed to provide acceptable results in short-term executions.
%
The principal reason is that most MOEAs converge to sub-optimal regions in a fast way, as result the search process could stagnate.
%
Therefore, in long-term executions some Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) are not capable to provide quality solutions.
%
Despite the fact that in literature has been showed that algorithms based in Differential Evolution (DE) perform significally better than Genetics Algorithms (GA) in short-term executions, 
in long term executions is unkown their behavior.
%
It is well known the stability issues of parameter-configuration of DE and the accelerated convergence that in general results in poor quality solutions, therefore GA operators can be ideal with this setting.
%
%
In this paper we propose several improvements to the Simulated Binary Crossover (SBX) where are considered the criteria stop as part of the search process.
%
Experimental validation with DTLZ, WFG and UFs problems shows the benefits of the proposal.
